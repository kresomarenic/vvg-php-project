					<h2>Makers are taking Halloween to the next level with these 3D prints</h2>
					<p class="description">No one does Halloween quite like the maker community</p>
					<p>
						The maker community is constantly creating new, fun and often innovative things using 3D printing, but it can sometimes be hard to keep track of all the amazing things going on, especially with so much happening on the industry side of things. At this time of year, however, I always find myself drawn back into what makers are up to, because the creative juices really seem to get going around Halloween.
					</p>
					<p>
						Though you can find lists upon lists of fun things to 3D print for Halloween, we want to take a look at some of the most original and cutting edge projects that we’ve come across this Spooktober. As usual, the maker community has not disappointed!
					</p>
					<p>
						Putting a creepy spin on a Halloween classic is maker William Bruning [Megawillbot], who shared his 3D printed Halloween Pumpkin Spider Transformer with the maker community on Thingiverse. The 3D printed model may look like a traditional pumpkin at first glance, until the pumpkin shell comes apart to reveal eight curved legs and a pair of sharp mandibles. The files for this 3D printable model can be downloaded for free, so makers can make their own version of the transformer Halloween decoration.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another maker’s project caught our eye on Facebook. Inspired by the cult classic Little Shop of Horrors, Australia’s Edward Felix 3D printed his very own Audrey II Venus flytrap. It wasn’t just a small 3D printing project, however, as the maker painstakingly recreated a grown (and well-fed) Audrey II using 3D printed parts, post-processing, paint and lots and lots of skill.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ultra realistic 3D printed Venus Fly trap would be impressive at any time of year, but we’re sure Felix will use his masterpiece as an awesome Halloween decoration. If the large scale print wasn’t quite enough, Felix has also created a miniature and robotic Audrey II (with the Maxwell House coffee can included!). You can check out more of the maker’s projects (including a 3D model for Audrey II) on his Thingiverse page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, if you’re looking for Halloween inspiration, look no further than the Adafruit blog, which every year features amazing and spooky 3D printed projects. This year’s highlight, for us at least, is an animatronic 3D printed Medusa headset created by maker Erin St Blaine.
					</p>
					<p>
						The impressive cosplay was inspired by the Gorgon from Greek mythology, Medusa, who had venomous snakes instead of hair and could turn those who looked at her to stone. The elaborate head piece integrates 3D printed components, a wig, DIY snakes and electronics. The whole look is complemented with a few 3D printed accessories, including snake wrist cuffs and the snake symbol from The Neverending Story.
					</p>
					<p>
						We’ll be keeping a close eye on the maker community and will begin regularly sharing and highlighting projects that grab our interest. If you’re working on anything that might interest our readers at 3dpbm, feel free to comment below or get in touch.
