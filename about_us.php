				<h2>What is 3D printing?</h2>
				<p>
					3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.
				</p>
				<p>
					The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.
				</p>
				<p>		
					3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.
				</p>
				<p>		
					3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.
				</p>
				<h2>How Does 3D Printing Work?</h2>
				<p>
					It all starts with the creation of a 3D model in your computer. This digital design is for instance a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file. A 3D model is either created from the ground up with 3D modeling software or based on data generated with a 3D scanner. With a 3D scanner you’re able to create a digital copy of an object.

				<h2>Learn How to 3D Print – Where to Start?</h2>
				<p>
					Getting started with 3D printing means asking yourself what you would like to learn first. Are you interested in the hardware, or do you want to focus on the end result – creating objects? Answering this question could lead you to the decision if whether you should buy a pre-assembled 3D Printer or a DIY 3D Printer kit. Read more in our 3D Printers for Beginners buyers guide.

					<b>Which 3D Printer Is Right for You?</b>
					Want to buy a 3D printer but you have a tight budget? Starting your journey into 3D printing doesn’t need to be expensive. There are plenty cheap 3D printers under $250.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides the examples above, there are a bunch of different elements which will help decide what the best 3D printer is for you. Will it be used in the classroom? Will it be used for small batch production? For more information, please read our buyers guide: the best 3D printers of 2018.
				</p>
				<h2>How much does a 3D printer cost?</h2>
				<p>
					So what determines the price of a 3D printer?
				</p>
				<p>
					For starters: parts. When a manufacturer uses high quality parts (motors, frame, electronics), this will affect the price of the end product. When the parts are of high quality it doesn’t automatically mean the prints will turn out great – there are too many other factors that play a role as well.
					When a manufacturer decides to go cheap on parts it can market the product for a good price. On the other hand it doesn’t automatically mean that a cheap 3d printer will give you bad print results. But you’ll probably have to put in more time and effort to get to the same level.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly there’s Research & Development. It can take years of groundwork and engineering before the final product is a stable, high quality 3D printer. Manpower can become costly overtime which ofcourse needs to be earned back.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next element that influences the price of a 3D printer is: assembly. In general it’s cheaper and more efficient to ship just the parts compared to a fully assembled 3D printer. This can be in the form of a DIY kit or a semi-assembled 3D printer. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all DIY kits or semi-assembled 3d printers are cheap. Cause some DIY kits contain such high quality parts that eventhough you have to assemble it yourself it’s still pretty expensive. Additionally some brands that market do-it-yourself kits put a lot of time and effort in making educational tutorials and focus on customer service – which also doesn’t come cheap.
				</p>
				<p>
					And this brings us to the last point that determines the 3D printer price: customer service & warranty.
				</p>
				<p>
					There’s a good chance you’ll run into problems when you buy a 3D printer. In case you’ve chosen a 3D printer from an established brand you’ll pay more but you will have the reassurance that there’s always support to back you up. Also, when for instance something breaks during shipping, you’ll be glad you chose a product with warranty.
